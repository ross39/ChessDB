# Chess DB 

The world needs an open source alternative to chessbase. I aim to create that. It will be free and open source. Any help is greatly appreciated. For the community, by the community. FOSS for life 

# The stack 
I am using tauri for now https://tauri.app/

The frontend is written in vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript. I find front end frameworks just too over engineered and complicated. I want something that just works and doesn't require monumental effort to learn. I may change this later on. The backend is written in rust.
